PLAN FOR WEBSITE

It's a place to read recipes
The recipes are not all from cookbooks
All recipes do have ingredients, a description, a name and an author

All cookbooks have recipes (name) and authors


APPS: recipes, cookbooks, ingredients, authors, names


WATCH for relations between the fields of the models


FUNCTIONALITIES:
- Visitor must be able to search for recipes based on author, cookbook and an ingredient - keep it simple!
- Visitor must be able to search for cookbook based on author


FRONT END:
- Home page with some explanation
- Menu horizontally with different pages: cookbooks, recipes, authors
- NO vertical columns anywhere
- Images
- Website is responsive
